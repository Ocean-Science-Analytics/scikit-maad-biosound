# Scikit-MAAD Acoustic Indices GUI

## Major Update: Frequency band fixes and GUI updates (August 2025)

This version merges and corrects multiple iterations of the marine acoustics GUI that had diverged across different research groups. The primary fix addresses frequency band calculation errors identified through correspondence with the scikit-maad development team.

### Key Technical Improvements

**1. Corrected Marine Frequency Band Assignments**
   - Anthrophony (vessel noise): 0-1000 Hz band properly isolated for ship traffic analysis
   - Biophony (biological sounds): 1000-8000 Hz correctly captures cetacean vocalizations and fish choruses

**2. Parallel Processing Implementation**
   - Multiprocessing support reduces computation time by factor of 2-4x
   - Configurable worker processes optimize for available hardware
   - Performance comparison mode available for benchmarking

**3. Run Metadata Tracking**
   - Comprehensive logging of analysis parameters, file manifests, and performance metrics
   - JSON and human-readable summary formats for reproducibility
   - Automatic versioning of sequential runs in the same output directory

**4. Restructured Output Organization**
   - Hierarchical folder structure: `data/`, `figures/`, `metadata/`
   - Metadata includes full parameter sets for method sections
   - Performance reports when comparison mode enabled

**5. Marine Acoustic Test Data Generator**
   - Synthetic WAV files with realistic frequency content
   - Scenarios: vessel transits, dolphin echolocation, fish aggregations
   - Proper timestamp formatting for GUI compatibility

### Migration Guide for Existing Projects

#### Previous Version Behavior
The original implementation:
- Saved all outputs directly in the selected output folder (flat structure)
- Calculated frequency bands incorrectly, using only the first two frequency thresholds
- Generated files: `Acoustic_Indices.csv`, `output_figures/` folder with plots
- No run tracking or metadata preservation

#### Current Version Behavior  
The new implementation:
- Creates organized subfolders: `data/`, `figures/`, `metadata/`
- Properly calculates frequency bands across full specified ranges
- Generates same core files but in organized locations
- Adds timestamped metadata files for each run (never overwrites)

#### Critical Considerations

**Frequency Band Corrections Impact These Indices:**
- **NDSI, BI, rBA** - Values will differ substantially from previous calculations
- **AnthroEnergy, BioEnergy** - Now correctly allocated to appropriate frequency ranges
- Other temporal and spectral indices remain unchanged

**File Naming and Overwrite Protection:**
The new **Run Identifier** field (optional) allows you to prefix output files with custom identifiers. The system provides comprehensive overwrite protection:

- Without identifier: `Acoustic_Indices.csv`, `correlation_map.png` (warns if files exist)
- With identifier "StationA_2024": `StationA_2024_Acoustic_Indices.csv`, `StationA_2024_correlation_map.png` (warns if identifier already used)

**Protection scenarios:**
- **No identifier + files exist**: Suggests adding identifier or changing folder
- **Identifier provided + files exist**: Warns about duplicate identifier, suggests modifying it (e.g., adding "_v2")
- **All cases**: User can cancel to make changes, or proceed with explicit overwrite confirmation

Overwrite decisions are recorded in the metadata for full traceability.

This enables flexible naming strategies:
```
outputs/
├── data/
│   ├── StationA_Spring_Acoustic_Indices.csv
│   ├── StationB_Spring_Acoustic_Indices.csv
│   └── StationC_Spring_Acoustic_Indices.csv
└── figures/
    ├── StationA_Spring_correlation_map.png
    └── StationB_Spring_correlation_map.png
```

Alternatively, use separate output folders for complete isolation between stations.

Metadata files are always timestamped and never overwritten, providing a complete history of all processing runs.

#### Recommended Migration Path
1. Create new output folders with "_corrected" suffix to distinguish from previous analyses
2. Process a subset of files to quantify the magnitude of index changes
3. Document the correction in methods sections of ongoing work
4. Consider reprocessing all historical data for consistency

## Overview

A GUI-based tool for batch processing marine passive acoustic data, built on the [scikit-maad](https://scikit-maad.github.io/) library. Designed specifically for underwater recordings, it computes acoustic indices with proper frequency band allocation for distinguishing vessel noise from biological sounds in marine environments.

## What This Tool Does

**The application:**
- Processes WAV files to compute 60+ acoustic indices (measurements of sound characteristics)
- Generates visualizations showing acoustic patterns over time
- Exports results as CSV files for further analysis in Excel, R, or other tools
- Handles batch processing of multiple audio files automatically
- Creates correlation maps and false-color spectrograms for pattern analysis

**Common use cases:**
- Long-term biodiversity monitoring
- Before/after environmental impact studies  
- Seasonal acoustic pattern analysis
- Habitat quality assessment through soundscape analysis

## Installation & Setup

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd scikit-maad-biosound
   ```

2. **Install uv** (if you don't have it):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```
   Or visit [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for other installation methods.

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv add numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-maad
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
5. **(Optional) Generate test files:**
   ```bash
   python generate_samples.py
   ```

That's it! The GUI will open and you can start processing audio files.

## Quick Start Guide

### Basic Usage

1. **Launch the application** using one of the installation methods above
2. **Select folders** in the GUI:
   - **Input Folder**: Directory containing your WAV files
   - **Output Folder**: Where results will be saved
3. **Optional: Add Run Identifier** to prevent filename conflicts
4. **Choose time scale**:
   - **Hourly**: Averages indices over 1-hour periods
   - **Dataset**: Processes entire files as single units  
   - **Manual**: Specify custom time intervals (in seconds)
5. **Optional: Adjust Acoustic Settings** (uses defaults if blank):
   - **Anthrophony Range**: Frequency range for human noise (default: 0-1500 Hz)
   - **Biophony Range**: Frequency range for biological sounds (default: 1500-8000 Hz)
   - **Sensitivity**: Hydrophone sensitivity (default: -35.0 dB)
   - **Gain**: Recording system gain (default: 0.0 dB)
6. **Click "Run Analysis"** and monitor progress bar
7. **Check your output folder** for results when done

### Input Format

WAV files must follow this naming convention:
```
[prefix]_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_[suffix].wav
```

Examples:
- `Recording_20240515_143022_001.wav`
- `Site1_20240101_060000_A.wav`

### Output Files

The tool creates an organized folder structure with your results:
```
your_output_folder/
├── data/
│   └── Acoustic_Indices.csv         # All computed indices with timestamps
├── figures/
│   ├── correlation_map.png          # Index correlation matrix
│   ├── individual_features.png      # Time series of 6 key indices
│   └── false_color_spectrograms.png # Visual representation of sound patterns
└── metadata/
    ├── run_metadata_*.json          # Detailed analysis settings and parameters
    └── run_metadata_*_summary.txt   # Human-readable summary of your run
```

**New:** Each analysis run is automatically documented in the metadata folder, making it easy to track what settings were used and reproduce your results.

## Generating Test Data

**New Marine Acoustic Test Files:** Generate realistic sample WAV files with marine sounds:

```bash
python generate_samples.py              # Create 5 sample files (default)
python generate_samples.py -n 10 -d 60  # Create 10 files, 60 seconds each
```

Sample scenarios include:
- **Quiet ocean** - Minimal activity baseline
- **Vessel passing** - Ship engine noise with some biological sounds
- **Dolphin pod** - Echolocation clicks (3-8 kHz)
- **Fish spawning** - Chorus sounds (500-2000 Hz)
- **Busy harbor** - Heavy vessel traffic

Test files are saved in `test_wav_files/` with proper naming convention and realistic frequency content for testing the marine acoustic features.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Index not available" in plots**
- Some indices (like ROItotal) may not be computed for all audio types
- The tool will show a gray placeholder and continue processing
- All successfully computed indices are still saved to CSV

**"No WAV files found"**
- Check that files have `.wav` extension (lowercase)
- Verify files follow the naming convention
- Ensure input folder path is correct

**Memory errors with large files**
- Try using shorter time intervals with Manual mode
- Process files in smaller batches
- Consider downsampling audio files before processing

## For Developers

### Running Tests

**Basic tests** (no external dependencies):
```bash
uv run python test_basic.py
```

**Full test suite** (requires all dependencies):
```bash
uv run python test_acoustic_gui.py
``` 

### Key Functions

- `run_analysis()` - Main processing pipeline
- `safe_plot_index()` - Error-resistant plotting
- `parse_date_and_filename_from_filename()` - Filename parsing

### Acoustic Indices

The tool computes indices in two categories:

**Temporal** (time-domain):
- ZCR, MEANt, VARt, SKEWt, KURTt, LEQt, BGNt, SNRt, MED, Ht, etc.

**Spectral** (frequency-domain):
- MEANf, VARf, ACI, NDSI, BI, ADI, AEI, Hf, TFSD, etc.

See [scikit-maad documentation](https://scikit-maad.github.io/features.html) for detailed descriptions.
